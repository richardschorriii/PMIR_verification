## Topology-Dependent Spectral Coupling in Phase-Space Networks: Evidence for Regime-Dependent Observational Structure

We demonstrate that phase-space coupling in networked dynamical systems exhibits fundamentally different regimes depending on the interaction between network topology and graph Laplacian spectral structure. Building on a five-preprint investigation establishing spectral-band universality in Phase-Modulated Information Rivalry (PMIR) dynamics, we test whether analogous regime-dependent behavior appears in graph-theoretic representations of planetary systems.

Using degree-matched graphs with controlled topological properties (random-regular vs. periodic grids), we construct phase-space networks from JPL ephemeris data and measure coupling strength across varying system sizes (N ∈ {256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}) and perturbation amplitudes. We quantify spectral irregularity via the coefficient of variation of Laplacian eigenvalue gaps (gap_cv) computed over low-frequency modes (k = 1 to 48).

Hierarchical regression analysis reveals a dominant topology × spectrum interaction effect (β = -273.53, 95% CI: [-379.38, -176.41], p < 0.0001). This interaction coefficient is 676-fold larger than the spectral main effect, demonstrating that spectral structure affects different topologies in qualitatively different ways. For random-regular graphs, spectral irregularity is statistically irrelevant to coupling (p > 0.05). For periodic grids, spectral irregularity strongly suppresses coupling, with the gap_cv slope differing by -273.64 between topological classes.

We interpret these results as evidence for two distinct observational regimes: a topology-dominated regime (analogous to Newtonian mechanics, where gross connectivity determines behavior) and a structure-sensitive regime (analogous to general relativity, where local geometric properties couple dynamically). The continuous transition between regimes, mediated by spectral organization, suggests that graph-theoretic phase-space representations naturally exhibit hierarchical structure mirroring known gravitational phenomenology.

All results are 100% reproducible (GitHub: richardschorriii/PMIR_verification; Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.18509187) and independently verified. The analysis employs a systematic 50-pass verification framework (PASS protocol) designed to eliminate statistical artifacts. This work establishes spectral-topological coupling as a measurable, regime-dependent phenomenon with potential implications for understanding how geometric structure emerges in observational hierarchies.
